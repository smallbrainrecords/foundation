                <p>Small Brain is a web based clinical information system.&nbsp; It's a radically different model than
                    first
                    generation EHRs.&nbsp; Our system has been designed to handle complex patients while capturing the
                    most
                    objective data generated during the encounter, all the while reducing time charting.</p>
                <p>We have worked with leading information scientists and physicians to create something revolutionary.&nbsp;
                    Check it out for yourself, it's an open source project so if you have the skills we will help you
                    get
                    started.&nbsp; If you need us to do all the tech work we can make that happen too.</p>

                    the
                    strange state of clinical informations systems and soon began to dream of making something truly
                    cool.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>We began by getting help.&nbsp; One of our earliest advisors was Charles Friedman who became our

                    Problems can be accessed by patients and physicians, and notes, images, orders and other relevant
                    data can
                    be added or reviewed by both user types.</p>
                <p>Tasks are also collaborative, allowing patients and their care team to manage the Todo list, and each
                    Todo provides a space for task specific communication.&nbsp; The system automatically connects the

                    the relevant clinical problem, and any clinical encounters it is referenced in.</p>
                <p>Encounters are audio recorded, compressed and uploaded all in the browser.&nbsp; The system
                    automatically

                <p>The system has been built to learn how I practice medicine, how I heal, how I recommend, how I use
                    the system
                    itself.&nbsp; The the set of actions we as physicians undertakes to care for patients is finite and
                    categorical.&nbsp; We started with a simple ontology for our prototype, and since then have
                    continued to add
                    and sub-categorize.&nbsp; This data set informs the system how I work, both in the context of a
                    particular
                    patient, but also in the context of a particular clinical problem and task. With continued use the
                    system
                    can predict what I will do next as I navigate through it, and so the buttons I click today are
                    teaching the
                    system how to follow and predict me autonomously.&nbsp; This is what you want as a unique
                    clinician.</p>
                <p>By starting with the most elemental model of healing we ensure that changes in technology will not
                    disturb the evolution of the system.&nbsp; We tested our model against every recorded instance of
                    the
                    healing act on the planet.&nbsp; You can drop this puppy into the hands of a tech happy shaman in
                    the wild
                    and they will find it as helpful as an urban internal medicine physician.</p>

                    that
                    retains the clinical context. Patients can grant access to family members or other individuals that

                <p>We're still in FHIR prototype mode but getting closer to full FHIR integration.&nbsp; Currently we
                    have three
                    prototype clinical modules built to experiment with modular design {a colon cancer, A1C, and
                    warfarin
                    management application}.&nbsp;&nbsp; These have been guiding our next architectural step toward full
                    FHIR
                    use.&nbsp; We have a FHIR server up and running and will be testing simple data exchange.
                    Ultimately our system can be used as a stand alone, or in concert with other systems.</p>
